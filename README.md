# FitandGo
FitandGo is a health management software built with java, springboot, MySQL, and thymeleaf. It follows the MVC pattern. 
Among various features of the software, here are some explanations: A user can create a profile and look for a gym/personal trainer/nutritionist/nutritionist chamber/hospital. The admin can add/delete/update any new gym/personal trainer/nutritionist/hospital of the area to the database.
I have applied unit testing for several features.
